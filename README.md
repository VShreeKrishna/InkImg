# InkImg

InkImg is a full-stack application that generates images from text using AI. The application consists of a React-based client and a Node.js server that interacts with the OpenAI API for image generation and MongoDB for data storage.

## Project Structure

The repository is divided into two main parts:

- `/client`: Contains the React client-side application.
- `/server`: Contains the Node.js server-side application.

## Features

- Generate images from text using AI.
- Store and retrieve generated images.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB
- OpenAI API Key
- Cloudinary Account (for image storage)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vshreekrishna/inkimg.git
cd inkimg
```

### Setup the Server

    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Setup the Client

1. Navigate to the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install client dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the client:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Available Scripts
